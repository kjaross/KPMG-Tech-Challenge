Challenge #3
"We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs

object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/
value = a

Hints
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir."

I'll use JS to implement the function.


Steps:"
#1 Install 'node' to execute JS:
$ brew isntall node

#2 Execute the script with the test cases:
$ node nested_objects.js
